# AI Learning Repo

## Start with [Andrej Karpathy](https://karpathy.ai/zero-to-hero.html)


### Lecture 1
- __Sept 4 2025__ - I think I spent a good two hours on topics today. I watched most of the fist Karpathy video. But stuggled a bit with where it was all headed.  I paused a bit of work on the Data Quest Calculus for ML lessons hoping that helps. Today was mostly just getting up to speed on some secant lines as you can see in my sandbox notebook
- __Sept 5 2025__, I did the Khan Academy Unit One lesson on Limits. This was helpful to me. Approx 30 minutes here. I started the next DataQuest section but was confused by limits. Work got busy and only did about 30 mintutes on Friday. Will try to make up this weekend
- __Sept 6 2025__, Watched Karpathy video. I decided to take the tactic of watching each video to understand the big picture  
and then watch again while working through the problems with him.
  - Note to watch KA on derivative rules to get a feel
  - started making more sense with the binary classifier neural net and the loss function.  The loss is the total performance  
  of your neural net. Use the MSE loss function.  
  Found it useful to think of the gradient as a vector pointing in the direction of loss. Still confused by back propagation  
  - watched KA videos on [derivatives](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-ab/ab-differentiation-1-new/ab-2-2/v/alternate-form-of-the-derivative)
  - time spent towards goal approx 90 minutes
  - __Sept 7 20205__ Good day, did not keep strick track of time. But around 2 hours. Got through the start of the karpthay video and felt like I was understanding it
