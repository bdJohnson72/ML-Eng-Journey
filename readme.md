### Lecture 1
- Sept 4 2025 - I think I spent a good two hours on topics today. I watched most of the fist Karpathy video. But stuggled a bit with where it was all headed.  I paused a bit of work on the Data Quest Calculus for ML lessons hoping that helps. Today was mostly just getting up to speed on some secant lines as you can see in my sandbox notebook
- Sept 5 2025, I did the Khan Academy Unit One lesson on Limits. This was helpful to me. Approx 30 minutes here. I started the next DataQuest section but was confused by limits. Work got busy and only did about 30 mintutes on Friday. Will try to make up this weekendK
