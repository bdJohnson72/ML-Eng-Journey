# AI Learning Repo

## Start with [Andrej Karpathy](https://karpathy.ai/zero-to-hero.html)


### Lecture 1
- __Sept 4 2025__ - I think I spent a good two hours on topics today. I watched most of the fist Karpathy video. But stuggled a bit with where it was all headed.  I paused a bit of work on the Data Quest Calculus for ML lessons hoping that helps. Today was mostly just getting up to speed on some secant lines as you can see in my sandbox notebook
- __Sept 5 2025__, I did the Khan Academy Unit One lesson on Limits. This was helpful to me. Approx 30 minutes here. I started the next DataQuest section but was confused by limits. Work got busy and only did about 30 mintutes on Friday. Will try to make up this weekend
- __Sept 6 2025__, Watched Karpathy video. I decided to take the tactic of watching each video to understand the big picture  
and then watch again while working through the problems with him.
  - Note to watch KA on derivative rules to get a feel
  - started making more sense with the binary classifier neural net and the loss function.  The loss is the total performance  
  of your neural net. Use the MSE loss function.  
  Found it useful to think of the gradient as a vector pointing in the direction of loss. Still confused by back propagation  
  - watched KA videos on [derivatives](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-ab/ab-differentiation-1-new/ab-2-2/v/alternate-form-of-the-derivative)
  - time spent towards goal approx 90 minutes
  - __Sept 7 20205__ Good day, did not keep strick track of time. But around 2 hours. Got through the start of the karpthay video and felt like I was understanding it
  - __Sept 8 2025__ failed to log but a little KA math
  - __Sept 9 2005__ Failed to log
  - __Sept 10 2025__  felt tired lots of work did not do any ML
  - __Sept 12 2025__ made good progress and started implement back propagation and started book [Why Machines Learn](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0593185749?psc=1&smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&ref_=chk_typ_imgToDp)  
  - __Sept 13 2025__ Finished Chapt 1 of Why Machines Learn, Watched 1 video on Linear Alg from 31Blue1Brown, great progress today  
    - on the Karpathy leture as well. Got the start of the neural net. I have a long way to go. But I felt like the book with the video really helped me understand
    - probably two + hours today 
  - __Sept 14 2025__ Beer Fest read Why Machines Learn for an hour
  - __Sept 15 2025__ Beer Fest Read Why Machines Learn for maybe 2 hours
  - __Sept 17 2025__ Beer Fest. Read Why Machines Learn. Watched 3Brown vid on NN. Continues with Karpathy. 1 hour
  - __Sept 18 2025__ Completed first karpathy video and started Makemore watch 3Blue1Brown on Neural Nets. Started book on sklearn and did start of housing regression.  
    - Not sure if I should drop that and just do Karpathy first
